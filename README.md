# MIC-1 Micro-Architecture Simulator

## About
This program simulates the working of a hypothetical computer to a certain extent defined in the book by Andrew S. Tannenbaum, Structured Computer Organization, 3rd Edition.
It will is written in C++, however I have decided not to write a graphical user interface.
The program can be run in a terminal window. There are basic functions for interacting with the simulator.
The simulator can load and run programs written in the pascal like language defined in the book.
There are a couple of exemplary programs in the folder `programs`.
In the future I might add and interface for executing and writing the programs in the terminal, but for now you can write
them manually and call the appropriate simulator functions in the main function.
